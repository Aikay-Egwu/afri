      <p class="">
        We provide relief for all Black African and Caribbean People, and advance the education and training of the BAC community and their dependants residing in Sunderland and its surrounding towns in Tyne and Wear and their dependents in the United Kingdom. <br/> We preserve and protect the physical and mental health, and raise the profile of people of African and Caribbean heritage, otherwise known as Black people using a display of African and Caribbean culture represented in story-telling, film; music, fashion, dance and  visual arts to facilitate a better understanding of African culture and heritage within our local community.
      </p>
      <p>
        We address the non-inclusion of the BAC community in the socio-cultural and economic activities through the delivery of community events and advocacy support, 
Membership is open to everyone from African heritage, and those with a positive interest in driving forward race equality   
Beneficiaries of our services are open to all people of African heritage, all Black & Minority Ethnic communities, with a focus on young people aged between 17-30 years old who are NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training), people over 50 years old who are unemployed, unemployed single parents, and refugees and asylum seekers.

      <p class="text-center text-h4 font-weight-thin">Activities</p>
      <p>
        We have created the space for the development of social ties, this has facilitated strong connections and have achieved social integration and community cohesion within the region.
We have raised the profile of the African and Caribbean people in Sunderland and surrounding towns,  we achieve this by organising African cultural and social events to break barriers, improve lives , we celebrate Black History Month every year and participate actively in other city wide events including the Tall Ships and Sunderland Air show. Black people are now consulted and recognised as stakeholders in Tyne and wear. 
Since the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, we have been carrying out door-to-door deliveries of food and hygiene essentials to Black people who are in self-isolation until they had been certified positive.
      </p>
      <p>We paid visits the Hope wood Mental hospital to visit our members who were receiving treatment for poor mental health as a result of the covid-19, the clinical lead nurse said their social health improved with every visit and they were discharged earlier than expected. </p>
      <p>What experience does your organisation have of delivering projects to the community? we have been funded by the Sunderland City Council and other organisations in Sunderland to deliver yearly events that promotes social participation and community cohesion. Such events include the yearly Black History Month, the Nelson Mandela centenary anniversary, the Sunderland Tall Ships and the International Air Show and supported the refugees and asylum seekers in delivering the celebration of Diversity and Integration in Sunderland. We have built capacity at the community level in supporting people of African heritage, majority of whom are affected by Wndrush documentation scheme and lack the motivation, information and drive to access the compensation scheme.</p>
      <p class="text-center text-h4 font-weight-thin">Funding</p>
      <p>We have been funded by the Sunderland City Council, Gentoo, the Cultural Spring, Sunderland Culture, and lately the African Health Policy Network to deliver series of activities that fosters integration. Our early Black History Month, the Nelson Mandela Centenary Anniversary and other citywide projects that we have taken part in has been used to promote cultural exchanges for better understanding and mutual respect and facilitating mutual expressive understanding of ethnic diversity. we have been known to use such fora to speak against systemic racism and prejudice.</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have been embarking on door to door delivery of food and essentials to black people who have been advised to self-isolate, and others in need. We are presently managing a £40,000 grant from the Peoples Health Trust to provide the space for us to meet, discuss common issues, and receive information, advice and support to people of African heritage.
We are presently managing a £40,000 grant from the Peoples Health Trust to provide information, advice and support to black people who are unemployed or underemployed, are on low income, have no skills or low skills, suffer from lack of confidence, are homeless, face social isolation or exclusion or suffer from mental health issues.</p>
